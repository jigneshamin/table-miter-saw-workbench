# What I learned building a Farmhouse Bench and Table

Woodworking is all about the precision in execution and adjustments to the eventual mistakes one makes during build. Similar to cooking, you can find woodworking designs and “how to” posts online. A lot of the blog posts talk about the steps they took and maybe some of the mistakes, but I wanted to write up my reflection to evolve my methods for future projects.

Making my table and bench can be summarized at the highest level to prep, execute, adjust, finish and clean up. I added clean up because it was a stressful part for me. After the mental tax of prepping, executing, adjusting and finishing, it’s easy to ignore the details of cleaning that will make the next phase easier.

## **Design**

I chose the design that included more straight cuts and less complex joinery. In order to get a feel of the piece in my kitchen, I wanted to design it out to the dimensions and “see” it fit.

### **Using SketchUp**

Use SketchUp to model out the product to the exact dimensions. For example, the digital prototype allows you to see how much clearance the benches will have when they are tucked under the table. Go further and design the pilot holes or joinery into the prototype; this can speed up the build process and limit time in adjustments.

Obvious benefit is the design, but you can also play with the angles to evaluate the structural integrity. And, if you keep the individual pieces as separate files, you can import them into layout sketches of your floorplans or outdoor spaces of your home.

## **Buy**

This build was intentionally sourced from Lowe’s as I knew my mistakes would be costly if I messed up designer hardwood. Plus, hardwoods look better with advanced joinery; I used  pocket holes to assemble the table and benches.

### **Selecting the right boards**

Select the lumber based on the budget for the project and the environment it will be used in. The end grain can be:

- Quarter sawn: Grain is close to 90 degrees to face. Best for tabletops as the width won't expand. Least available.
- Rift sawn: Grain is between 30 and 60 degrees to face. More available, and can be milled from larger boards.
- Flat sawn: Grain is around 0 or 180 degrees to face. This is typically what you get from Home Depot or Lowes. Least structural, but most available.

In the table build, I noticed a lot of splits in one of the boards. I thought this would be an interesting characteristic. I could just fill the crack with epoxy. This was a mistake.

I chose the center of the tree. The end grain showed the center of the ring, which is known as the pith. The cracks created from the center points cause weakness in the product; always take function over design. If buying wood from Home Depot or Lowes, make sure you can mill out the quarter or rift sawn parts with the table saw.

## **Cut**

The tools of the cut process and the skills needed were important for me. I wanted to spend more time on the miter and table saws to get used to them. This design did not use much of the circular or jig saws, but will plan on using those more in the next projects.

### **Planning mitigates stupidity**

Select the faces of the lumber that will orient the pieces. Look for interesting characteristics, e.g. knots, grains, that will add to your product. Mark the orientations on the faces. Pencil in the cut lines on the initial piece of stock to cut. Add a stop block to the first cut, so that you don't have to remeasure and all cuts will have very similar lengths.

### **Know the functions of your tools**

For the bench, I notched out a joint (lap joint) for the bottom stretcher in the legs using the table saw. Set the depth of the saw to half of the leg and just repeated cuts to chisel out remaining wood. For the table, I realized the miter saw has a depth control screw. This was much easier and, for me, safer as I was in control of the blade at all times.

### **Staying safe with saws**

For the miter saw, I received kickback when cutting the benchtop boards. For the table saw, I had to rip off the edge of the benchtop boards, so I decided to pause and study before potentially receiving kickback on the table saw.

To understand the kickback, I learned that the wood surrounding the cut is pinching any extremely fast moving blade. When friction is hits the fast moving blade, kickback occurs. The objective is to make sure the stock (the piece you're keeping) and the waste (the piece is that is scrap) are separated from the blade after the cut.

- Table saw: Keep stock between blade and fence. Stand directly behind stock. Push in parallel to the line being cut. Keep stock firmly against the fence avoiding stock touching the **back** teeth of the blade. Use the fence for rips.
- Miter saw: Keep the miter base slightly above the support for the stock. The ends of the stock and the waste should never fall down toward the blade. This means your base is below the support. Use stop blocks for cross cuts.
- Circular saw: Secure the stock to the support. Let the waste fall away from the blade with gravity.

### **Cross cuts after assembly**

To create the table top, I chose to cut the boards longer than 52”. I leveled one side using one breadboard, then glued the boards together leaving one side rough. I used the other breadboard as a guide, and cut with the edge with a circular saw. I set up the guide incorrectly - left edge of the blade guide (and hence the handle, body, etc. of circular saw). The motor of the saw contacted the cut guide. The blade guide was not flush with the stock. The cut was not 90 degrees as my blade was angled. The cut was not straight, nor flush with edge of board.

Circular saws should only cut in one direction. Right edge of the blade guide should be against the cut guide. The left edge of the blade guide should be on top of the waste. Essentially, waste on left, and stock and clamped guide on right.

### **Clean up**

Dust collection systems get about 80% of the dust. Blow off the above-ground cutting space with shop vac or leaf blower. Sweep the floor using wide broom. Use compressed air to clean the tools. Blow out the entire space after with leaf blower.

## **Fit**

Fitting my pieces tested my cuts, lengths and overall design. This process also gave me a nice pause to plan out before assembly and possibly alter the design a bit. After assembly, is a point of no return where adjustments are needed, rather redesign.

### **You can never have enough clamps**

Use clamps to square up the pieces. Mark areas where joins will not be perfect.

- Plan for filling gaps between joins.
- Plan for sanding rough areas.
- Plan for clamping edge joins during assembly.

### **Planning for structural integrity**

Mark pilot holes for screws thinking about how to access them during assembly. Use level or straightedge to smooth out joins. Sand down pieces with 60 grit as needed to remove material. Keep the saw dust for filling gaps later.

## **Assemble**

Assembly of the table of benches included of wood glue and pocket hole screws. The primary inputs to assembly were space to work, attention to leveling detail, and patience to manually adjust before fastening.

### **Setting the pilot holes**

Plan for the drill sequence. Space pilot holes no more than 12" and at least 6” apart. Use spade bits to create wider holes if using plugs.

### **Gluing and screwing up the pieces**

Glue should be spread with flat edge or brush. Clamp pieces together to position boards before glue sets. Glue should bubble just a bit on the surface of the join. Once boards are positioned together, screw in joins to set the piece. (This is where biscuits and dowels eliminate the manual positioning.) Use damp sponge to clean the joins before dry or a chisel after dry.

### **Clean up**

Scrape off the glue as much as possible. Glue left on the surface will be sanded into the grain causing defects on the surface when staining. Wipe down product with damp sponge to clean off any dust. Sweep floors from pilot hole dust.

## **Sand**

Sanding the table and the bench eliminated the need to plane the top surfaces. Initially I attacked the piece of wood with the sander and focused on specific areas. A smooth, consistent application is needed, especially during and after the application of 120 grit.

### **Moving around the sander**

Move from 80 to 120 to 150 to 220 grit across the assembled product. Do not use circular motions with orbital sander. Move sander directly with the grain. Finesse on pressure of the sander will come with experience. Too much pressure causes the sander to “buck”.

### **Protecting the eyes and lungs**

Dust safety needs improvement as my chest hurt after sanding. Use respirator mask and avoid using simple face masks like a t-shirt or bandana. Clean out the sander's dust collection from time to time. Open the workspace to increase ventilation. Attach vacuum hose to orbital sander to avoid dust from remaining in workspace.

## **Fill**

Using rough lumber, there are a lot of imperfections on the wood already. And, gluing the boards together edgewise without dowels or biscuits added imperfections at the seams. Filling the knots and gaps with epoxy, instead of wood glue, and sand dust was the chosen method for this build.

### **Creating the dough**

Understand the proper mixture of sand dust to epoxy ratio. Pour the sanding dust into a container gently and add a few drops of wood glue or epoxy. Stir the mixture thoroughly. Continue to add more wood glue or epoxy one drop at a time until you have created a thick paste with plenty of sticky, clumpy sanding dust and no visible evidence of the wood glue or epoxy. The mixture should be tacky, not wet. The idea is that the sanding dust will soak up more of the stain than the epoxy, so it will look like wood grain rather than fill.

### **Applying the dough**

Use painters tape to isolate seams and avoid spreading the paste onto surface. Use putty knife or laminate sample to work paste into gap or hole. Feather out paste and scrape off excess. Remove the tape and address any adhesive on the surface. Avoid sanding adhesive into the grain.

## **Trim**

After assembly, the first adjustments is to continue to remove materials, but in the form of shaping the assembled pieces. You can trim with routers or planes, and the surfaces can be planed or ultimately sanded.

### **Rounding the corners**

Round or flush trim edges before filling and after assembling product. The stock should feed into the direction of the bit. For my router, bit turns clockwise. So, the freehand router direction is left to right on an edge or away if I am standing behind the stock.

### **Clean up**

Open the workspace to allow dust to naturally exit. Sweep large dust. Use compressed air to clean the tools. Use blower to push any remaining dust out of the workspace.

## **Stain**

The application of stain is not as tedious as the clean up. Stain is simply lathered on, but needs attention so it soaks evenly into the wood, hence the wiping of excess. Since I used oil-based stain, the clean up is tedious because of the potential for the rags to combust in the trash.

### **Planning for the setup of the product**

Think about reaching the different areas, the drying orientation, what needs to be stained and what doesn’t - outside, inside, underside. Protecting the workspace with drop cloths or cardboard. For the tabletop, it was interesting to orient the table and plan for the apply and dry times for the topside and underside. I ended up staining the bottom first, then flipping over on 2x4 scraps to “dry” while I apply on the topside. For the seal, I applied all 3 coats of polyurethane to the top before flipping and applying 1 coat to the underside.

### **Preparation and application**

Prep wood with a dry cloth, then compressed air, then vacuum with bristles, then a damp cloth. Ensure piece is completely over protective material - brown paper, cardboard, or drop cloth. Pre-stain wood with conditioner. Apply conditioner with rag or foam brush. Wait 30 minutes, then wipe away excess. Use old shirt or rag to apply oil-based stain. It is optional to wipe away excess on first coat. Let dry 8 hours. Add wood plugs before second coat. Soak rags in a little mineral spirits inside a plastic bag. Remove air. Wring out before applying second coat.

### **Go from large surfaces to small surfaces**

Staining the details and gaps. Pocket holes and gaps between joins were not stained fully. Left bright lines of the raw wood that can still be seen.

### **Clean up**

Dry the stained rags in the sun. Wait until stain has hardened on cloth. Toss in garbage. Toss brown paper. Fold up cardboard or drop cloth for use during sealing.

## **Seal**

Sealing is bit more tedious than staining as the final stroke requires a smooth and steady “tip off” to remove the bubbles that may have formed in the polyurethane. But, since 3 coats is ideal, the application became easier after each.

### **Preparation and application**

Prep wood with dry wipe, then compressed air, then vacuum with bristles, then a damp cloth. Use natural bristle, decent quality brush. Prep for clean up before applying seal. Gather 2 jars, mineral spirits, dry paper towels, and gloves. Apply polyurethane at 45 degrees and try to apply in one long stroke with the grain. Avoid brushing. Let dry for 3 to 4 hours. Sand with 220 block before next coat. Apply 3 coats.

### **Clean up**

Pour 1/8 inch of mineral spirits into one jar. Soak brush with spirits by brushing and dabbing bristles into the jar. Pour dirty spirits into other jar. Shake out spirits from brush. Dry with paper towel. Repeat 3-5 times. Trim bristles if any have frayed out. Put brush into original packaging or plastic bag to maintain shape or bristles. Pour out dirty mineral spirits.
