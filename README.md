# Table and Miter Saw Workbench

## Purpose
This workbench will be the central workhose for the garage. It wil provide infeed and outfeed capabilities for the table and miter saws. Also, it will provide storage for dust collection and additional tools under the table. It will be supported by casters so it can be moved around in the garage.

## Materials
The framing will be all 2x4s from Lowes and the table top will be 3/4" Birch plywood to provide a smooth and stable surface.

## Learning Goals
This piece was pretty straightfoward for tools and cuts. It's all butt joints and square cuts made with table, miter, jig, circular and reciprocating saws fastened with 3" construction screws. Measuring out the specific heights for the recessed platforms for the saws is critical to have a proper outfeed.
